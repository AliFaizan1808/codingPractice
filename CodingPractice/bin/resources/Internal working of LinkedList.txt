LinkedList in Java is a data structure that represents a linear collection of elements where each element is a separate object called a "node." 
These nodes are connected to each other using two references: one points to the previous node, and the other points to the next node. 
This structure allows you to efficiently insert and remove elements from the middle of the list.


Lnked list it is not saved in contineous memory.

Here's an easy-to-understand explanation of the internal working of a LinkedList with an illustrative diagram:

**LinkedList Structure:**

In a LinkedList, you have nodes like this:

```
Node 1       Node 2       Node 3
[Data] <-> [Data] <-> [Data]
   â†‘
Start of the LinkedList (head)
```

Each node has two parts:
- Data: This is where the actual element (or value) you want to store is kept.
- References: There are two references per node:
  - One points to the previous node (if it exists).
  - The other points to the next node (if it exists).

**LinkedList Head:**

The LinkedList has a special reference called the "head," which points to the first node in the list. It's the starting point for traversing the list.

**Illustrative Diagram:**

Let's say you have a LinkedList with three nodes containing the values "A," "B," and "C." The diagram would look like this:

```
    +---+         +---+         +---+
    | A | <-----> | B | <-----> | C |
    +---+         +---+         +---+
```

- "A" is the first element, and it's connected to "B."
- "B" is connected to both "A" (as the previous node) and "C" (as the next node).
- "C" is the last element in the list and is connected to "B."

**Insertion:**

When you want to insert a new element, like "D," between "B" and "C," you create a new node for "D." Then, you adjust the references like this:

```
    +---+         +---+         +---+         +---+
    | A | <-----> | B | <-----> | D | <-----> | C |
    +---+         +---+         +---+         +---+
```

Now, "D" is connected to "B" as its previous node and "C" as its next node. "B" and "C" also have their references updated to point to "D" appropriately.

**Deletion:**

If you want to remove "D" from the list, you simply update the references like this:

```
    +---+         +---+         +---+
    | A | <-----> | B | <-----> | C |
    +---+         +---+         +---+
```

Now, "D" is disconnected from the list, and the references of "B" and "C" are adjusted accordingly.

This is the basic idea of how a LinkedList works internally. It's a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink as elements are inserted or removed.
 Each element is stored in a node, and these nodes are connected through references, allowing for efficient operations on the list, 
especially for insertions and removals.


Basically it uses the doubly linked list above -


brief of singly and doubly linked list -


A doubly linked list is a variation of the linked list data structure in which each node has two pointers instead of one. In addition to the next pointer, 
which points to the next node in the list, a doubly linked list also has a previous pointer, which points to the previous node in the list. 
This bidirectional linking allows for more versatile operations compared to a singly linked list, where you can only traverse the list in one direction.

Here's a summary of the key differences between a doubly linked list and a singly linked list:

1. **Direction of Traversal:**
   - Singly Linked List: You can only traverse the list in one direction, typically from the head (the beginning) to the tail (the end).
   - Doubly Linked List: You can traverse the list in both directions, forwards and backwards, thanks to the previous and next pointers in each node.

2. **Memory Overhead:**
   - Singly Linked List: Requires less memory per node because it only stores one reference (next).
   - Doubly Linked List: Requires more memory per node because it stores two references (previous and next).

3. **Insertions and Deletions:**
   - Singly Linked List: Insertions and deletions at the beginning are efficient, but insertions and deletions in the middle or end require traversing the list 
to find the appropriate location.
   - Doubly Linked List: Insertions and deletions at any position (beginning, middle, or end) are more efficient because you can easily traverse in both directions
 and update the references.

4. **Complexity:**
   - Singly Linked List: Simpler to implement due to its unidirectional nature.
   - Doubly Linked List: Slightly more complex to implement due to the bidirectional references but provides additional flexibility.

Here's a simplified diagram to illustrate the difference between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list:

**Singly Linked List:**
```
    +---+    +---+    +---+
    | A | -> | B | -> | C |
    +---+    +---+    +---+
```

**Doubly Linked List:**
```
    +---+    +---+    +---+
    | A | <-> | B | <-> | C |
    +---+    +---+    +---+
```

In a doubly linked list, each node (e.g., "B" in the diagram) not only points to the next node (e.g., "C") but also points to the previous node (e.g., "A"). 
This bidirectional linking enables more efficient traversal in both directions and simplifies certain operations like inserting or deleting nodes in the middle 
of the list.

Doubly linked lists are commonly used in scenarios where you need efficient bidirectional traversal, such as certain types of data structures, algorithms, 
and applications like text editors with undo/redo functionality. However, they come with the trade-off of increased memory usage due to the additional 
references in each node.
